This WIP PR is for preparing content for the start page.

Please commit your ideas until 2019-05-11 so that we can discuss on the next web meeting about the design.

Solutons could be:

* screens (can take a lot of content)
* carousel/slides (all at top, do not take much content)
* carousel/slides with screens (teaser + _learn more_-button)

## Green Open Access
_(Citation advantage of OA https://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/ )_

Many researchers do not use their right to make their papers freely available online, in addition to the paywalled version offered by traditional publishers.

There are two major advantages of unpaywalling your papers:
1. There are a lot of studies giving evidence, that freely available publications have a higher citation rate. 
This is called the _Open Access Citation Advantage_. You can find a list of studies on https://sparceurope.org/what-we-do/open-access/sparc-europe-open-access-resources/open-access-citation-advantage-service-oaca/oaca-list/ 
As a conclusion: Your research is not only more acknowledged, but pushes scientific advantage in general, because your research better spreads!
1. Libraries do not need to by overpriced electronic subscriptions to journals, when they can afford them at all.

## Open repositories
Uploading your papers on your own webpage is not enough. Such copies are less stable and harder to find than documents uploaded to well-indexed repositories.
There are for a lot of major repositories like arXiv, chemRxiv and institutional repositories. Nearly all of them are searched by BASE and CORE. And they ensure a long-term availability of your research.

Dissemin searches for copies of your papers in a large collection of open repositories and tells you which ones cannot be accessed. 

## Statistics
_(With d3js it sould be easy to create some fancy, dynamic on-the-fly-graphs)_

Since __%date__ __%number__ of publications have been uploaded via dissemin. This make __%number__ publications per week.
_%time series graph_

## Success-Story
_(Get some data from zenodo, maybe contact the depositor?)_

The publication __%publication__ was uploaded on __%date__ and got __%number__ downloads and __%number__ views on Zenodo!

The depositor says: Uploading this publication on dissem.in was the best idea I ever had!

We have another __%number__ publications with at least __%number__downloads on Zenodo.


## Dissemin for libraries
As library you can use Dissemin to find publications of your researchers that are behind a paywall and add them to your local repository. Depending on your needs you can connect your repository or get information from our API. 

In addition you can advertize Dissemin to your researchers and show them, how easy it is to liberate their papers!

# Time limited content

## Connect your Repository
_(We can show that if we have connected some repos from different software vendors.)_

Dissemin can upload publications directly into your institutional repository. Dissemin tries to support your local workflow as much as possible. Benefit from Dissemins capabilities and get in contact with us!
